      <p className="subtext">
        Revision felt like having a coach watch my form. Peer and instructor comments pointed out where my drafts were
        wobbling: weak transitions, uneven evidence, or overlong intros. I took those notes back to the rack and adjusted
        structure, reordered paragraphs, and tightened wording until the movement felt clean.
      </p>
      <p className="subtext">
        One assignment that changed the most was my proposal draft. The first pass was all over the place, but after
        feedback I cut fluff, clarified methods, and added stronger connections between sections. Seeing the before and
        after made me appreciate revision as real training, not punishment: each edit was another coached rep that made
        the final piece stronger.
