      <p className="subtext">
        I opened the semester like a warm-up set, testing what felt tight or awkward and figuring out where I was
        curious. I knew I cared about writing and gym culture, so I built questions that could actually carry weight:
        how people talk about fitness online, how language in gyms shapes belonging, and where writing shows up in
        places we do not always notice. Early assignments pushed me to slow down and stretch those ideas instead of
        rushing into heavy lifts.

      <p className="subtext">
        One assignment that showed my growth was the line-of-inquiry draft. At first my questions were broad and
        scattered, but after feedback I rewrote them to be specific and answerable, like locking in a grip before the
        bar leaves the rack. That shift helped me see inquiry as an intentional warm-up, not just random reps. It matches
        the Generating Inquiry outcome because I moved from vague interest to genuine, researchable questions about
        writing, language, and gym culture.
