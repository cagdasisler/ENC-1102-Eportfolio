        Working on this outcome felt like drilling technique, changing stance, tempo, and grip until the lift moves
        smoother. I experimented with different modes and formats: adding visuals to break up dense explanations,
        color-coding feedback to spot weak spots, and trying more conversational language when a piece needed energy.
        Those choices were my form adjustments, each one meant to keep the audience engaged and the purpose clear.

        A multimodal draft taught me the most. Once I layered images and annotations, I could see where my argument
        sagged or rushed, the same way a mirror shows if a squat is shallow. That experiment proved that changing the
        mode can unlock clarity and help readers follow my movement from claim to evidence.
