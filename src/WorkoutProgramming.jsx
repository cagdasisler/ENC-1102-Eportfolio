        Programming a lift cycle means setting reps, sets, and rest. Programming a research project was similar: I had
        to decide the genre, structure, and audience before I started moving weight. In my research proposal, I laid out
        the intro, lit review, methods, and significance like phases of a program, making sure each part had a purpose
        and flowed into the next.
      </p>
      <p className="subtext">
        The proposal showed me how to work inside constraints, like sticking to percentages on a strength plan. I chose
        methods that matched my questions, organized evidence so it ramped up logically, and kept the tone academic
        without losing my voice. That planning mindset carried into later assignments and kept me from overloading one
        section while neglecting another.
