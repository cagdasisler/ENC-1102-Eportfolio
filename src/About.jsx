      <p className="subtext">
        My name is Cagdas Emre Isler. I am an international student from Turkey studying Computer Science. ENC 1102 was
        more fun than I expected because it let me balance writing with the same discipline I use for coding and
        lifting. Building this ePortfolio at the end of the semester felt like a bonus project where I could mix design,
        programming, and reflection.
      </p>
      <p className="subtext">
        Outside of class I like working out and experimenting with software projects, so tying the gym theme into my
        writing made the work feel more personal. I hope the tabs here show how my writing grew over the semester and how
        I kept pushing for better form in both essays and code.
