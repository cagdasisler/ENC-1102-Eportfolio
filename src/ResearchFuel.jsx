        Good lifts need good fuel, and good writing needs solid sources. I learned to check if an article was clean
        fuel: relevant, credible, and ethical before loading it into my work. That meant using databases instead of
        random blogs, looking at who the author is, and skipping anything that felt like empty calories. When feedback
        called out a weak source, I swapped it for a stronger one and felt the whole draft move smoother.

      <p className="subtext">
        In my research log assignment, I documented where each source came from and why it belonged in the program.
        Writing those notes was like tracking macros: it forced me to notice if I was leaning too hard on one type of
        evidence and to rebalance before the final paper. That habit made my later drafts steadier and more trustworthy.
